Speaker Recognition at the Cocktail Party
=========================================
*A crowded, noisy place. Do you hear me?*
-----------------------------------------

Imagine that you are at a cocktail party with friends in a noisy room. How do I recognize them using just your hearing? The answer is given by solving the problem of recognizing speakers in a multi-speaker environment.

This project allows you to solve the stated problem. One of the main approaches the usage of a special regularization technique - mixup augmentation [1].
